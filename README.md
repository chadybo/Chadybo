**`Recent graduate (B.S. Computer Science)`**

Hi! I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Stony Brook University (B.S. Computer Science) and currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology (M.S. Computer Science). I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue growing in the field. My primary interest lies in the security aspects of AI, particularly in safeguarding and evaluating the robustness of machine learning models.
